             Founder - Roger Brown
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg  mb-8">
              Roger rides his bike the way others do yoga — as a form of meditation. When the wind rushes past him and the world gets loud, that’s exactly when he finds his peace.
              He is a magician when it comes to using motion, speed, and the lens to slow everything down. Riding, camping and photography are more than hobbies for him.
            </p>
            <p className='text-lg  mb-8'>
              It is how he processes the world and sees beauty in the chaos. He's got the heart of an adventurer and the soul of a saint — grounded, thoughtful, and always seeking. He is also a proud dog dad to two adorable pups who are basically his shadows. They bring out the softer side of a guy who already has a golden heart.
