        The Psychology of Branding: Why your logo is only 10% of the story
      </h2>

        Let’s clear something up: your logo is not your brand. It’s just the tip of the very large, very complex, emotion-laden iceberg floating in the mind of your customer.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
        Your logo is important because it’s a visual signature, a symbol, a badge. But without the rest of your brand built around it, it’s just an empty shell. Like dressing a mannequin in designer clothes and hoping someone falls in love with its personality.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
        If you want your brand to stick, resonate, and—dare we 
        say—connect, then it’s time to go deeper. <br />  <o className="border-2 border-[#1B3C53] bg-[#1B3C53] text-white uppercase whitespace-nowrap" >Let’s talk about branding psychology,</o> color choices, emotional hooks, tone of voice and why consistency is everything.

      </h2>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        Humans don’t buy with logic. They buy with feelings and then use logic to justify those feelings. This means your brand has to do more than explain—it has to feel.

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>What do you want people to feel when they interact with your brand?</li>
          <li>Trust? Excitement? Belonging? Confidence?</li>

        <strong className='text-[#1B3C53]'>Example:</strong> Think of Apple. People are not buying tech with it because there are many other brands selling it. They buy identity. Sleek, modern, minimal and powerful. This means, your brand should aim to be more than a name, it should be a mood.

          <span className="text-[#fff] ">02.</span> The silent power of color psychology
      </h2>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        Colors influence perception before a single word is read. Here’s a quick cheat sheet to understand the psychology behind different colors:
      </p>
      
 <div className="bg-[#234C6A] p-6 rounded-lg my-6 border-l-4 border-[#fff] text-white">
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Red:</strong> Excitement, urgency, energy</li>
          <li><strong>Blue:</strong> Trust, calm, reliability</li>
          <li><strong>Green:</strong> Growth, health, prosperity</li>
          <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Optimism, warmth, creativity</li>
          <li><strong>Black:</strong> Sophistication, luxury, power</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        But beware, it’s not universal. Context, culture, and contrast all matter. Bold red might work for an energy drink, but probably not for a law firm.
      </p>

          <span className="text-[#fff] ">03.</span> Tone of voice: How your brand sounds when it talks
      </h2>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        Your brand speaks even when you don’t. From website copy to social captions to email subject lines, it’s all part of the conversation.
      </p>
      
            <div className="bg-[#234C6A] p-6 rounded-lg my-6 border-l-4 border-[#fff] text-white">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-[#fff]">Is your brand:</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Friendly or formal?</li>
          <li>Witty or wise?</li>
          <li>Bold or humble?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        The secret sauce: Tone is about how you say things. A bakery and a law firm might offer the same promise of reliability, but they will say it very differently.
      </p>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        <strong className='text-[#1B3C53]'>Tip:</strong> Imagine your brand as a person. Write like they talk.

      </h2>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        The human brain loves patterns. The more someone sees the same logo, hears the same tone, and feels the same vibe across different platforms, the more likely they trust you. Or in other words, inconsistency triggers doubt.
